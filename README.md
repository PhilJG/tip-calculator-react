## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This was was the most challenging FE mento project yet. Despit it not being fully functional I learned alot about Javascript with this one. It would be difficult to pin down which part specifically because of it was quite new for me. And there is still much more imporvement needed which I may add later. I just feel like I got close enough with this one and one to move on to something new and fresh.

### Continued development

I need more practice in reseting the page and figuring out how to remove input fields on refresh. I also need to learn more about regex. Get better at laying out the program structure and logic before starting may help reduce the spagetti code which is abundant in this one.

### Useful resources

- [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - His course has been my main guide on this javascript journey I can`t recommend his tutorials enough.
- [Fireship - Regular Expressions (RegEx) in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM) - This is tutorial was great to give me the quick and dirty regex syntax which clear up a pretty confusing concept.
