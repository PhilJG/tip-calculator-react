## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This projet was developed from a Frontend Mentor project with vanilla Javascript. I wanted to do a more complex webapp at the time and this seemed like a good oppertunity. It didn`t really come out how I wanted. After learning react I decided to revisit it.

### Continued development

One of the difficult challenges from this was moving the props through the different components and rendering the solutions in different components. 

### Useful resources

- [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - His course has been my main guide on this javascript journey I can`t recommend his tutorials enough.
- [Fireship - Regular Expressions (RegEx) in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM) - This is tutorial was great to give me the quick and dirty regex syntax which clear up a pretty confusing concept.
